# HackMIT2019-BigKahunaBoys -> PATHENA
# Public Safety, simplified. 

Pathena is a navitation application, but instead of looking the fastest route, it looks for the safest route, while staying efficient.

Our submission version of Pathena allows the user to pick two arbitary points in the city of Berkeley, and Pathena will automatically choose the safest path between the two points. 

The safety of the area was calculated by crime statistics provided by the city of Berkeley, which is avaliable at https://data.cityofberkeley.info/.

## Visions of Pathena

Pathena was created with long term goals in mind. Here are sneaks peeks of the features to come!

### Heatmap/Coolmap
In addition to navigation, Pathena will aggregate crime statistics in a region and create a heatmap. The goal is to preemtively warn users of their surrounding areas to give better safety insights.

### Social media integration
User submitted social media data will be aggregated in addition to crime statsitics to supplement the representation of the safety of neighborhooods where crime data may be insufficient to accurately analyze the safety.
